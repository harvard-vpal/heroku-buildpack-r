# Heroku buildpack: R

This is a [Heroku buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) for applications which use
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) for statistical computing and [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) for R packages.

The master branch of this repository contains the canonical version of the buildpack for use by IQSS/VPAL-R.

## Usage

To use this version, the buildpack URL is `https://github.com/harvard-vpal/heroku-buildpack-r`.

The buildpack will detect your app makes use of R if it has a `run.R` file in the root directory.

### Installing R Packages

The buildpack requires you are using [Packrat](https://github.com/rstudio/packrat) to lock down package dependencies. You must run `packrat::snapshot()` before making your first push to Heroku. If you modify the snapshot by adding, removing, or changing a package, you must clear the Heroku build cache before redeploying (see **Caching** below).

### Installing Binary Dependencies

If the R packages have binary dependencies, they can be specified by providing an `Aptfile` in your repository's root that contains the Ubuntu package names to install.

For instance, Tidyverse packages need `libxml2-dev` and RPostgreSQL needs `libpq-dev`. Examine the log of a failed `git push heroku` command for names of other Ubuntu/Debian dependencies your R packages might need.

### R Console

You can run the R console application as follows:

```
$ heroku run R ...
```

Type `q()` to exit the console when you are finished. You can run the Rscript utility as follows:

```
$ heroku run Rscript ...
```

_Note that the Heroku slug has an ephemeral file system and is effectively read-only, so any changes you make during the session will be discarded._

### Shiny Applications

See [apache-shiny-demo](https://github.com/harvard-vpal/apache-shiny-demo) for an example Shiny app that uses this buildpack and [heroku-buildpack-apache](https://github.com/harvard-vpal/heroku-buildpack-apache) to enable multiple, load-balanced R processes.

### Scheduling a Recurring Job

You can use the [Heroku scheduler](https://addons.heroku.com/scheduler) to schedule a recurring R process.

An example command for the scheduler, to run `prog.r`, would be `R -f /app/prog.r --gui-none --no-save`.

## Technical Details

### R Versions

The buildpack uses R 3.4.3 by default, however it is possible to use a different version if required. This is done by providing a `.r-version` file in the root directory, which contains the R version to use.

The following R versions are provide:

* 3.3.3
* 3.4.0
* 3.4.1
* 3.4.2
* 3.4.3

### Buildpack Versions

To reference a specific version of the buildpack, add the Git branch or tag name to the end of the build pack URL when creating or configuring your Heroku application.

E.g. Replace `branch_or_tag_name` with the desired branch or tag name:

```
$ heroku create --stack heroku-18 \
    --buildpack https://github.com/harvard-vpal/heroku-buildpack-r.git#branch_or_tag_name
```

### Buildpack Binaries

The binaries used by the buildpack are hosted on AWS S3 at [https://heroku-r-buildpack.s3.amazonaws.com](https://heroku-r-buildpack.s3.amazonaws.com).

See the [heroku-buildpack-r-build](https://github.com/virtualstaticvoid/heroku-buildpack-r-build) repository for building the R binaries yourself.

### Process Types

The buildpack includes the following default process types:

* console: Executes `bash` in the chroot context, if needed for debugging.
* web: Executes `run.R` to run Shiny in the chroot context

The `R` and `Rscript` executables are available like any other executable, via the `heroku run` command.

### Caching

To improve the time it takes to deploy, the buildpack caches the R binaries, any additional binaries installed using the `Aptfile` and the compiled package binaries. If you need to purge the cache, it is possible by using [heroku-repo](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-repo) CLI plugin.

To install the plugin run:

```bash
heroku plugins:install heroku-repo
```

To purge the buildpack cache, run the following command from your application's source code directory:

```bash
heroku repo:purge_cache -a your-app-name
```

See the [purge-cache](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-repo#purge-cache) documentation for more information.

### Multiple Buildpacks

This buildpack can be used in conjunction with other supported language stacks on Heroku by using multiple buildpacks. See [Using Multiple Buildpacks for an App](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-multiple-buildpacks-for-an-app).

See the [ruby](test/ruby) application which shows how to use R together with a Ruby Sinatra web application and the [`rinruby`](https://rubygems.org/gems/rinruby) gem.

### CRAN Mirror Override

It is possible to override the default CRAN mirror used, by providing the URL via the `CRAN_MIRROR` environment variable.

E.g. Override the URL by setting the variable as follows. **Note**: There is no trailing "slash" in the URL.

```
heroku config:set CRAN_MIRROR=https://cloud.r-project.org
```

Check the CRAN [mirror status](https://cran.r-project.org/mirmon_report.html) page to ensure the mirror is available.

## Caveats

Due to the size of the R runtime, the slug size on Heroku, without any additional packages or program code, is approximately 150Mb.
If additional R packages are installed then the slug size will increase.
